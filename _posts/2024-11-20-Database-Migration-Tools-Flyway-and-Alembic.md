## How to Use Flyway and Alembic?

### **1. Steps to Use Flyway**
1. Install Flyway.
2. Initialize the project and configure `flyway.conf`.
3. Create migration scripts (e.g., `V1__init.sql`).
4. Run migrations: `flyway migrate`.
5. Check migration status: `flyway info`.

### **2. Steps to Use Alembic**
1. Install Alembic: `pip install alembic`.
2. Initialize the project: `alembic init <directory>`.
3. Configure the database connection.
4. Generate scripts: `alembic revision --autogenerate`.
5. Apply migrations: `alembic upgrade head`.
6. Roll back migrations: `alembic downgrade <version>`.
